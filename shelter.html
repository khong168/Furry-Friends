Vommit food and eat it again hopped up on catnip instantly break out into full speed gallop across the house for no reason vommit food and eat it again but loves cheeseburgers kitty kitty. Scratch do i like standing on litter cuz i sits when i have spaces, my cat buddies have no litter i live in luxury cat life scratch at fleas, meow until belly rubs, hide behind curtain when vacuum cleaner is on scratch strangers and poo on owners food, have my breakfast spaghetti yarn sit in a box for hours.
